    "All experiments and associated resources are managed within your Azure Machine Learning workspace. You can connect to an existing workspace, or create a new one using the Azure Machine Learning SDK.\n",
    "\n",
    "In most cases, you should store workspace connection information in a JSON configuration file. This makes it easier to connect without needing to remember details like your Azure subscription ID. You can download the JSON configuration file from the blade for your workspace in the Azure portal or from the workspace details pane in Azure Machine Learning studio, but if you're using a compute instance within your workspace, the configuration file has already been downloaded to the root folder.\n",

    "> **Note**: The first time you connect to your workspace in a notebook session, you may be prompted to sign into Azure by clicking the `https://microsoft.com/devicelogin` link,  entering an automatically generated code, and signing into Azure. After you have successfully signed in, you can close the browser tab that was opened and return to this notebook."
